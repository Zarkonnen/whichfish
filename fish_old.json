    "explanation": "<p>Information was compiled from four main sources: the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the Marine Conservation Society, FishWatch, and the Greenpeace Red List. Individual entries have lists of sources, and I have aimed to reach a verdict solely based on the information contained in the sources. MCS ratings of 1-2 are considered \"sustainable\", and a rating of 3 is acceptable if other sources label the fish as sustainable. Information from these sources was supplemented by data directly from the IUCN red list. A IUCN rating of \"least concern\" was considered \"sustainable\".</p><p>Where there was serious contradiction, or the differences between sustainable and unsustainable sources of a fish was too involved, I have erred on the side of caution.</p><p>With some fish labeled unsustainable there will be exceptions where you can source them sustainably from specific places.
